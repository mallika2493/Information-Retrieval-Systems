amesplot extensible software system designed make display 
data simple painless neat system 
hardware-independent implemented variety installations 
of manufacturers diverse configurations elements 
common types data plots outlined 
elements combined system based simple modules demonstrated 
these modules independently independent axis
systems attributes plot enables plots any
complexity constructed adding replacing modules the
basic syntax amesplot outlined description given
of utility software consisting macros produce
self-scaled plots formal tablets text-interspersed subplots 
map coastlines 3-d plots system formulate
d user supply minimum information 
and fully integrable user program written
in conventional higher languages functions positioning 
locating scaling layout multiple subplots of
axes labels elements plot handled automatically
by software system user specifies structuring 
of plots multiple independent self-contained subplots 
transformation projection scaling rotation shifting entire plots 
subplots action simple modules user 
may interact freely amesplot levels enabling construct 
his data markers alphabetic characters transformations and
to produce variety artistic effects
