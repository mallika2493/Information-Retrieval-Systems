this paper describes symbolic execution of
programs supplying normal inputs 
to program numbers supplies symbols representing
arbitrary values execution proceeds 
as normal execution values symbolic
formulas input symbols difficult 
yet interesting issues arise symbolic execution
of conditional branch type statements 
particular system called effigy symbolic
execution program testing debugging 
also interpretively executes programs written
in simple pl style programming language 
 includes standard debugging features ability
to manage prove things symbolic 
expressions simple program testing manager program
verifier discussion relationship 
between symbolic execution program proving included
