the intrinsically exponential complexity of
the circularity problem attribute grammars

attribute grammars extension context-free
grammars devised knuth mechanism 
for including semantics context-free language
with syntax language circularity 
problem grammar determine semantics
for sentences programs 
fact defined proved problem
is general computationally intractable 
 specifically shown deterministic algorithm
which solves problem infinitely 
many cases exponential amount timen improved
version knuth circularity testing algorithm 
is actually solves problem exponential time
