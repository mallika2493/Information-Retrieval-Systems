a heuristic approach inductive inference fact retrieval systems

heuristic procedures presented have
been developed perform inferences generalizing 
from information procedures make use
of similarity structure imposed 
data base nonnumerical clustering algorithms they
are implemented model fact retrieval system 
which formal query language property-list data
structure program experiments 
wherein procedures test data bases
which altered deleting part data 
by purposely introducing false data found that
the system infer correct response 
a variety conditions involving incomplete inconsistent data
