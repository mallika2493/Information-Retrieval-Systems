a note linear programming algorithm design combinatorial problem

as linear programming models grow bigger and
bigger size actual data 
memorized put magnetic tape disk and
consequently improportionality fast 
rise consumption computer timeo cut down
this expense increasing effort made 
to design efficient algorithms paper is
meant support effort attempted 
find characteristics pivot column
is found number repetitions 
transfer data tape core memory considered 
 simplification problem restated 
in general generating function probability
distribution moment generating 
function number repetitions found asymptotic
formulas moments 
a result paper narumi results
may applied write efficient routines 
that search extreme table formulas
provide means calculating computer timings
