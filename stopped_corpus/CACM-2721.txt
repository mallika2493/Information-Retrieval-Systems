this paper deals development a
mathematical model digital simulation 
in fortran iv phytoplankton zooplankton population
densities river previously developed 
rate expressions order study relationships
between ecological mechanisms involved 
simulation parameters varied illustrating the
response ecosystem conditions 
including types chemical
and thermal pollution investigation 
of accuracy simulation methods simulation
of actual population dynamics asterionella 
in columbia river made based approximations
of conditions river totally 
accurate simulation found predict general
annual pattern plankton growth fairly 
and specifically revealed importance annual
velocity cycle determining patterns 
 addition study demonstrates usefulness of
digital simulations examinations 
aquatic ecosystems environmental
planning involving examinations
