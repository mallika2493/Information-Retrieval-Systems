divisor divide- and- correct methods

this paper presents analysis normalization
requirement divisor divide-and-correct 
method analysis made subject condition
that correction required 
to obtain true quotient character trial
estimate division two-precision 
segment partial remainder suitably rounded
single-precision divisor segmented division 
is denoted 2 1 precision basic division 
 found normalization requirement 
could narrowed smaller range divisors 
provided magnitude character 
the leading character divisor known 
however normalization eliminated 
has choose proper higher precision segments operands
for basic division considered 
the possibility eliminating normalization an
increase number corrections quotient 
estimate 2 1 precision basic division 
 shown scheme economical 
for small radices
