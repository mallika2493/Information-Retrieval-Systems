a case study code generation technique compilers

recent developments optimizing techniques
have allowed design compilers emerge 
 compiler translates parsed source code into
lower level code sequence steps 
step expands higher level statements blocks of
lower level code performs optimizations 
on result statement possible
expansion-the task tailoring code take 
advantage special cases optimizations 
 paper evidence 
strategy result good object code the
traditionally difficult pl concatenate statement 
was investigated detailed set fairly
simple optimizations identified allow 
the compiler produce good code elaborate optimizations
can improve object code 
 contexts concatenate statement code
produced compiler expansion-optimization 
strategy compares favorably the
code produced conventional pl optimizing
