on accurate floating-point summation

the accumulation floating-point sums is
considered computer performs t-digit 
base floating-point addition exponents range
-m algorithm accurately 
summing t-digit floating-point numbers of
these numbers split parts forming qn 
t-digit floating-point numbers then
added auxiliary t-digit 
accumulators finally accumulators added together
to yield computed sum qn n-1 
t-digit floating-point additions performed under
usual conditions relative error computed 
sum 1-t 
with additional n-1 t-digit additions 
computed sum corrected full t-digit accuracy
