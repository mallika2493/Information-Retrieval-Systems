in cases properties atom considered individually 
do adequately limit number sets matchings 
several applications technique field chemistry
are 1 pharmacology searching common constellation
of atoms molecules possessing similar biological activities 
 2 x-ray crystallography fitting structure structural fragment
to set peaks electron-density distribution of
