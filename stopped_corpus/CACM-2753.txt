a heuristic problem solving design system
for equipment furniture layouts

the designer problem solver dps demonstrates
that computer perform simple design 
tasks designs furniture equipment
layouts task chosen 
simple defined characteristic design
tasks architecture engineering urban planning 
and natural resource management space planning
tasks involve manipulating two-dimensional 
representations objects create feasible optimal
solutions problems involving topological 
and metric spatial constraints paper describes
extensive tests performed program dps 
a heuristic problem solver planning phase prefixed
to planning process give 
it sense direction diagnostic procedures locate
difficulties remedial actions recover 
from difficulties convex polygon representation
to accurately describe objects 
layout representation topological and
metric constraints tested design 
be easily updated dps applied 50 problems 
 slow limited scope 
ideas general demonstrates need
for selectivity controlling search 
methods achieve task-specific information 
planning diagnostic procedures remedial actions 
and selective alternative generators
