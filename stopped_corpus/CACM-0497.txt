in recent paper bellman showed dynamic
programming determine solution 
to problem previously considered stone problem
comprises determination 
n points subdivision interval and
the line segments give 
best squares fit function interval 
 bellman confined primarily 
analytical derivation suggesting briefly 
how solution equation derived 
particular point subdivision reduced to
a discrete search paper computational 
procedure considered fully similarities
to stone equations 
 shown equation involving
no minimization found addition 
it shown bellman method applied the
curve-fitting problem additional constraints 
are added ends line segments curve
