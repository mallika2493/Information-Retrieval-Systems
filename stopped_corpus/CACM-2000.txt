a variation goodman-lance method for
the solution two-point boundary problems

a recently published method interpolative
solution nonlinear equations improved 
and applied give significant variation goodman-lance
method solution two-point boundary problems 
the resulting method applies numerical solution
of optimal control problems euler-lagrange formulation 
quantitative estimates presented variation
