a common tool proving termination programs well-founded
set set ordered admit infinite descending sequences 
the basic approach find termination function maps
the values program variables well-founded set 
such termination function repeatedly reduced
throughout computation termination functions required 
are difficult find complexity out
of proportion program consideration multisets bags 
over well-founded set sets admit multiple occurrences
of elements ordering induces
an ordering finite multisets multiset ordering
is shown well-founded multiset ordering enables the
use simple intuitive termination functions otherwise
difficult termination proofs multiset
ordering prove termination production systems 
programs defined terms sets rewriting rules
