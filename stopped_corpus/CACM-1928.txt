a technique simulating detailed logic
networks large active digital systems 
is essential objectives sought improved
ease economy model generation economy 
in execution time space facility handling
simultaneous activities main results obtained 
are clear separation structural behavioral
model description reduction 
tasks converting boolean logic structural model 
the elimination processes achieving 
exclusive simulation activity event-scheduling
technique deteriorate economy
as event queue grows length simulation
procedure deals effectively mixture 
of serial simultaneous activities passage of
time simulated precise quantitative fashion 
and systems simulated combinations synchronous
and asynchronous logic aspects 
of techniques simulation
of network structures digital networks
