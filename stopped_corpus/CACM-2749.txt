this paper compares method simulation
organization called significant event method 
with called clock pulse method using
as examples automobile traffic models 
significant event method found efficient
than clock pulse method low levels system 
interaction efficient high levels simple
mathematical model trade-off 
relative running time methods developed 
the model aids choosing simulation 
methods experiment concluded
that significant event method 
in simulation systems computational
efficiency sufficient importance
