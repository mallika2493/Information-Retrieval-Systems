numerical techniques presented computing
the roots polynomial equations applying 
the recommended scaling inversion rules basic
bairstow newton-raphson iterative techniques 
can applied great reliability high degree
of accuracy rapid convergence realized 
 numerical examples shown illustrate pitfalls
and show circumvented application 
of recommended procedures
