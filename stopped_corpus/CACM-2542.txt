a critical failure software system
design implementation methodology 
the performance proposed design evaluated
before actually implemented paper 
the reasons failure explored methodology
which overcomes difficulties 
is proposed system integrates performance evaluation
with design implementation 
 system based simple high level language
which describe evolving system 
at stages development source language
description direct input performance 
analysis simulation routines performance
information obtained routines 
feedback problems adversely affect performance
are detected early 
be corrected costly major reimplementation proposed system
