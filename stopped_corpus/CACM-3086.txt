the decision tree complexity computing the
measure union possibly overlapping 
intervals shown log comparisons
between linear functions interval endpoints 
are allowed existence log lower bound
to determine real numbers 
are demonstrated these
problems provide excellent opportunity 
discussing effects computational model on
the ease analysis results produced
