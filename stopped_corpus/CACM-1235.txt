a computer program will
assign word english text form 
class part speech program operates relatively
high speed limited storage space 
 half word-events corpus identified
through small dictionary function 
words frequently occurring lexical words suffix
tests logical-decision rules employed 
to code additional words finally remaining words
are assigned class basis 
of probable form classes occur already
identified contexts conditional probabilities 
used basis coding empirically derived
from separate hand-coded corpusn preliminary
