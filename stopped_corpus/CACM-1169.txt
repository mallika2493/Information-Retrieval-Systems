a integer function algorithm 
finds local minimum evaluating set delta
f increments 
set exchanges elementshen exchange
corresponding negative increment 
 delta performed process iterated stopped
when set increments positive 
or empty set proved corresponds a
minimum procedure similar downhill 
method finding minimum real function 
and applied placement problems 
 experimental results presented backboards formed
