a procedure inverting large symmetric matrices

in squares method simultaneous
adjustment parameters coefficients 
of normal equations elements symmetric
positive-definite matrix order solve 
the normal equations evaluate precision measures
of resulting parameters inversion 
matrix coefficients required procedures
for matrix inversion take advantage 
of symmetry programmed high-speed
computer 2 elements stored 
manipulated 1 2 independent 
 order allow computer memory 
capacity handle larger matrix procedure
for inverting symmetric matrix
