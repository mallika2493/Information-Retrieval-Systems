a approach problem scheduling
course examinations presented principle 
an examination schedule requires minimum number
of examination periods satisfies constraint 
that student required take examinations
simultaneously found steps 
course examinations scheduled at
the period grouped 
ways minimum number groups that
each course included selected 
 removing multiple occurrences courses scheduling
each group period minimal 
schedule obtained known algorithms carrying
out procedures prohibitively expensive 
 approximations ideal procedure outlined are
given yield nonminimal feasible schedules 
with small expenditure time results experiments
using techniques 
are encouraging experimentation worthwhile
