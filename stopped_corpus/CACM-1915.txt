an algorithm hidden line elimination

the algorithm presented elimination of
hidden lines representation perspective 
view concave convex plane-faced objects the
picture plane edges objects 
considered sequentially planes hide every
point edge found computing time 
increases roughly square number edges 
 algorithm takes advantage reduced number 
of concave points recognizes only
one object concave points considered 
in case result obtained simpler
