a practical approach managing resources avoiding deadlocks

resource scheduling allocation expensive
with regard time space multiprogramming 
or time-sharing environments involving large numbers of
tasks resources conflicting requirements 
 detection prevention deadlocks require
massive amounts additional overhead efficient 
usage resources maintained resource
management program linked 
lists techniques overcome large
portion overhead program 
currently running part large scale general purpose
operating system keeps resources 
active detect prevent deadlocks
in implemented state 
would permit comprehensive levels deadlock
prevention detection additional cost 
been incorporated running system due
to infrequency deadlock situations
