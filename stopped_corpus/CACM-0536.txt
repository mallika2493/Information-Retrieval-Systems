nonlinear regression solution simultaneous equations

if set observables z1 zm which
are bound relation parameters 
 a1 equation z1 a1 0 frequently
has problem determining set 
values ai minimizes sum squares of
differences observed calculated values 
of distinguished observable say zm solution
of equation zm zm z1 a1 
gives rise function nonlinear ai 
then rely version gaussian regression 
 iteration scheme converges minimizing
set values shown 
same minimization technique solution
of simultaneous necessarily linear equations
