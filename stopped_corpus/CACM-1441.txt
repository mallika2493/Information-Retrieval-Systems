a system trivial function evaluations

a study made determine methods
of numerical integration require 
computation time amount truncation error
when applied system ordinary 
differential equations function evaluations are
relatively trivial recent methods due butcher 
and gear compared classic runge-kutta kutta-nystrom
and adams methods newer one-step 
methods due butcher found slightly superior 
but method found great 
advantage application problem
