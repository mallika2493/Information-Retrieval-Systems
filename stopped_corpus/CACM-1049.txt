solution nonlinear two-point boundary-value
problems extremely difficult task 
 questions reality uniqueness 
there established numerical technique 
this problem present shooting techniques the
easiest method attacking problems 
these fail difficult method finite differences
can obtain solution 
this paper examples discusses finite difference
method non-linear two-point boundary-value
