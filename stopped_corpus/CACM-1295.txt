a simplified technique presented pert
time calculations topological ordering 
 event assigned unique memory location activity
is represented link link defined 
as memory location address another
memory location time information 
activity carried link typical net 
the majority activities 
one 36-bit cell remainder 36-bit
cells links unidirectional forward 
during calculation expected completion time for
an activity backward calculation 
 time latest allowable completion activity 
the calculations progress net topologically
