a dynamically microprogrammed processor characterized
by small 4 64-bit word read-write 
 micro storage access time storage is
similar cycle time machine 50-100 
nsec microstorage data
and subroutines micro instructions 
such processor differ conventional that
they perform purely combinatorial operations 
sequencing control microinstruction 
the presence read-write microstorage 
permits flexible assignment resources the
read-only storage processor 
developed paper stresses simultaneous operation
 microinstruction adder 
shifter masker testing facilities processor 
 microassembly language developed 
the overhead involved subroutine linkages analyzed 
 efficiency flexible software linkage 
scheme examined overhead subroutine
characteristics finally examples 
of problem-oriented programming considered the
resulting coding compared system 360
