the self-judgment method curve fitting

a computer-oriented method processing and
communicating numerical data 
instrument reliability factors irf exactly
define limits reliability measured 
item information compute maximum
permitted error mpe values 
of ordinate self-judgment principle sjp 
is discard wrong information compute 
mean values parameters mpe terms
of irf data compatibility tests 
number equations made quickly 
otherwise intractable problems easily solved 
and design experiments greatly simplified 
 computational mathematical techniques 
used reduce bias sjp discussed inadequacies
in statistical graphical methods 
of curve fitting noted
