on complexity lr testing

the problem determining arbitrary
context-free grammar member easily 
parsed subclass grammars lr grammars
is considered time complexity problem 
is analyzed considered fixed
integer considered parameter 
of test case shown for
every exists 2 algorithm 
testing lr property size the
grammar question hand 
k subject grammar problem parameters then
the complexity problem depends strongly 
on representation chosen specifically 
it shown problem np-complete 
when expressed unary expressed in
binary problem complete nondeterministic 
exponential time results carry many
other parameterized classes grammars 
the ll strong ll slr lc strong lc grammars
