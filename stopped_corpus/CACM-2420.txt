automatic theorem-provers need made much
more efficient mind slagle 
shown axioms partial ordering replaced
by built-in inference rules 
theorem-proving algorithm based hyper-resolution and
paramodulation rules embody transitivity 
of partial orderings close relationship between
 predicates program developed 
a modified version rules theorem-prover
has found powerful solving 
problems involving partial orderings paper presents
a detailed description program 
a comprehensive account experiments performed
