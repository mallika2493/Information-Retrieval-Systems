an exponential method numerical integration
of ordinary differential equations

a formula numerical integration prepared 
which involves exponential term 
formula compared standard integration methods 
and shown large class differential 
equations exponential formula superior stability
properties large step sizes 
formula large step size decrease the
total computing time solution significantly 
particularly engineering problems high accuracy needed
