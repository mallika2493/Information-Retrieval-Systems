storage set internal external 
direct address set introduced program
sequence termed m-admissible relative 
to specific execution time period mapping
underwhich effective data referents 
are located direct address set storage
allocation considered process establishing 
for arbitrary program sequence mappings decoupling
of program m-admissible subprograms 
and linking set interludes existence proof
in terms completely interpretive program 
as special cases discussed various
restrictions generality programs 
considered practical realization
of allocation processes tractable
