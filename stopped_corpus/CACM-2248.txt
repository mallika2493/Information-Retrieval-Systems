a method solution the
cauchy problem parabolic equations

an integral equation representation given
for parabolic partial differential equations 
 equations defined unbounded domains as
in initial cauchy problem solution 
of integral equation method successive
approximation inherent advantages 
methods error bounds methods order 3 2 
and 7 2 increment size depending 
on finite difference approximations involved
