the structure programming languages

the identified major components
of programming language 1 elementary 
program statement 2 mechanisms linking elementary
statements 3 means 
a program obtain data inputs alternative
forms components 
compared evaluated examples frequently from
list processing languages illustrate forms 
described elementary program statements take
the form commands requirements implicit 
specifications command imperative statement
that commands action requirement 
describes effect achieved saying anything
about actions implicit 
specification similar requirement programmer
must understand actions 
to achieve desired effect subroutines entered
explicitly execute call function 
composition explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions execute 
subroutine call syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction programming language 
 function composition convenient alternative to
the explicit call principal ways 
getting inputs routines 1 referring to
the data 2 referring data 
a 3 referring implicitly means
of variables functions names 
entry points permanent data structures can
be error-causing distractions contexts 
the author discusses advantages disadvantages factors
influencing choice form component 
for language concludes suggesting evolution
of programming languages 
will permit convenient ways structuring
programs organizing systems referencing 
data
