equations based continued fraction approximations

a integration algorithm found an
implementation compared programmed 
algorithms algorithm step-by-step procedure
for solving initial problem ordinary 
differential equations designed approximate
poles small integer order solutions 
of differential equations continued fractions obtained
by manipulating sums truncated taylor 
series expansions method compared with
gragg-bulirsh-stoer taylor series method 
 taylor series method method shown
to superior speed accuracy 
new method shown superior solution
is required singularity method 
can finally seen pass singularities
where methods 
discussed failed
