requiring large numbers events

the event-manipulation system presented consists of
two major parts part addresses 
the familiar problem event scheduling efficiency
when number scheduled events grows large 
 part deals apparent problem
of providing efficiency flexibility scheduled 
events accessed executed additional features
and problems dealt include proper handling 
of simultaneous events events created 
scheduled executed points 
in simulated time infinite loops caused concatenation
of zero-time events 
and diagnosed maintaining event
counts practical economical 
capability handling time-displaceable events desirable
