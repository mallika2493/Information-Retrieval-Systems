list processing systems designed to
facilitate production large programs manipulate 
large complex symbolic data stores paper presents
an overview number system features 
the author feels important improve productivity
of programmers working domains 
system view focusing language
features algorithms 
coded language form debugged modified made
efficient run data general 
framework requirements applicable
to design advanced programming systems 
a wide range applications aspects programming
systems highlighted good interactive 
facilities programmable control structures sophisticated
data communication mechanisms interactive 
features facilitate program composition 
entry testing debugging editing optimization 
and packaging implementation generalized environment
structure model allow programming 
of control regimes including multiprocesses 
coroutines backtracking alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern monitoring condition need 
for extended data forms storage management extensibility
are stressed duality data 
retrieval function evaluation syntax directed
input output data facilitate 
complex data stores
