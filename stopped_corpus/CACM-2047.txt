algorithm symmetric tridiagonal matrices

the qr iteration eigenvalues symmetric tridiagonal matrix 
be accelerated incorporating sequence origin shifts origin shift
may subtracted directly diagonal elements of
the matrix incorporated means implicit algorithm both
methods drawbacks direct method unnecessarily degrade small 
eigenvalues implicit method effectively loose shift 
thereby retard convergence paper presents method 
neither drawback
