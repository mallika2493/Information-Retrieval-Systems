in paper supposed variables
x1 xn finite range variable 
xi taking pi values values the
variables changing time supposed 
further desired detect occurrences which
some subset variables achieve 
values finally supposed problem involves
the detection large number combined 
occurrences large number values of
variables efficient solutions problem 
are methods unusual property
of faster systems sum p1 
 pn larger solution error-free
and suitable cases solution 
is slightly elegant negation well
