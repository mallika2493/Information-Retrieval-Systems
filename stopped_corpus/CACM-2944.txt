this paper discusses techniques enable automatic
storage reclamation overhead partially 
shifted compile time paper assumes transaction
oriented collection scheme proposed 
deutsch bobrow features are
summarized implementing optimizations 
requires global flow analysis performed the
source program shown compile time 
certain program actions affect reference counts
of cells deduced information 
used find actions cancel code executed
and grouped achieve improved 
efficiency
