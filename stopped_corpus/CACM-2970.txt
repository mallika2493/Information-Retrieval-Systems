this paper extends regenerative
property queueing systems analysis 
of simulation output describes a
sequential estimation method 
the regenerative property results obtained
with statistical accuracy method 
includes test check normality assumption on
which sequential procedure relies paper 
illustrates method empty idle state
as regenerative state 
describes frequently entered state
as regenerative state reduces chance 
making costly error preliminary simulation run 
 paper variance reduction 
method due page obtain specified
accuracy considerably fewer job completions 
than required variance reduction technique applied
