optimal togram matching monotone gray level transformation

this paper investigates problem optimal
his togram matching monotone gray level 
transformation assigns picture points
of gray level gray level 
t objective
is find transformed digital picture 
a picture sum absolute errors
between gray level togram transformed 
picture reference picture minimized 
 equivalent placing k1 linearly ordered 
objects sized k2 linearly ordered
boxes assorted sizes 
accumulated error space packed overpacked
in boxes minimized placement function 
is monotonic ensures polynomial time solution
to problem tree search algorithm 
optimal togram matching presented time
complexity k1 k2 monotone property 
is dropped problem np-complete 
even restricted k2 2
