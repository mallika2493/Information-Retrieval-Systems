the language programs written
can substantial effect reliability 
of resulting programs paper discusses experiment
that compares programming reliability 
of subjects statically typed language typeless 
language analysis number errors 
and number runs errors shows at
least environment statically 
typed language increase programming reliability 
detailed analysis errors made subjects 
in programming solutions reasonably small problems
shows subjects difficulty manipulating 
the representation data
