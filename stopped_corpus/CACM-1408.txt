the prime function drum operating in
real time perform accesses quickly 
usual means increasing capacity incorporate
engineering hardware improvements 
this paper problem attacked changing the
drum modifying manner 
it operates outset drum functional
definition simple design scheme eschenbach 
is introduced enormously increases rate of
accessing drums defined shown 
enable system perform job employing fewer or
less expensive drums suggested 
the design scheme specific method underlying it
has general applicability question 
of efficacy drum scheme raised to
deal standard efficiency developed 
in light realistic real-time circumstances drum
scheme modelled manner permits 
it analyzed problem queueing theory 
thus enabled ascertain drum 
scheme efficient application 
whereas analysis drum scheme
