finding zeros polynomial q-d algorithm

a method finds simultaneously zeros
of polynomial developed rutishauser 
has tested number polynomials real
coefficients slowly converging method 
quotient-difference q-d algorithm starting
values newton bairstow algorithm 
more rapid convergence sufficient conditions
for existence q-d scheme 
not completely known failure occur when
zeros equal nearly equal magnitudes 
success achieved cases tried with
the failures traceable equal magnitude 
difficulty cases computer roundoff result
in errors spoil scheme 
q-d algorithm give zeros 
it find majority
