exploratory experimental studies comparing
online line programming performance

two exploratory experiments conducted at
system development corporation compare debugging 
performance programmers working conditions
of on-line line access computer 
are known studies measure programmers 
performance controlled conditions standard 
tasks statistically significant results experiments
indicated faster debugging online 
conditions important practical finding
involves striking individual differences 
in programmer performance methodological problems encountered
in designing conducting experiments 
are limitations findings pointed
out hypotheses presented account results 
and suggestions made research
