the conversion limited-entry decision tables
to optimal near-optimal flowcharts 
algorithms

two algorithms deriving optimal and
near-optimal flowcharts limited entry decision 
tables presented take account rule frequencies
and time needed test conditions 
 algorithms called optimum-finding algorithm 
leads flowchart truly minimizes 
execution time decision table simple rules
are contracted complex rules 
other called optimum-approaching algorithm requires
many fewer calculations necessarily 
produce optimum flowchart algorithms first
derived treating decision tables 
an else-rule optimum-approaching algorithm
is shown equally valid tables including 
such rule algorithms compared existing
ones applied large decision 
table derived real case comparison two
conclusions drawn 1 optimum-approaching 
algorithm lead results comparable
existing require 
but computation time 2 general the
greater computation effort needed applying 
the optimum-finding algorithm justified
by small reduction execution time obtained
