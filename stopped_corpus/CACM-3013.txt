this note describes operators respond
to step edges ramps 
is similar digital laplacian max rather
than sum differences 
 difference mean and
median gray levels neighborhood outputs 
obtained operators applied set test
pictures compared 
the standard digital laplacian gradient third
operator distance center 
and centroid neighborhood edge also
briefly considered turns equivalent 
to standard digital approximations gradient
