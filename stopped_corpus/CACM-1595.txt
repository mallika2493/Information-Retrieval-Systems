on computer enumeration finite topologies

the problem enumerating number topologies
which formed finite point 
set considered theoretically computationally 
 fundamental results established 
leading algorithm enumerating finite topologies 
and computed results 7 
 interesting side result computational work
was unearthing theoretical error 
had induced literature computer
in combinatorics represents chronologically 
an early application side result underscores
its continuing usefulness area
