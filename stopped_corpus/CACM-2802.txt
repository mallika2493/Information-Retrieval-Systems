the math computer programming

structured programming proved important
methodology systematic program design 
and development structured programs identified
as compound function expressions algebra 
of functions algebraic properties function
expressions permit reformulation expansion 
as reduction nested subexpression independently
of environment modeling 
is known stepwise program refinement program
execution finally structured programming 
is characterized terms selection solution
of elementary equations defined 
algebra functions solutions in
general formulas involving single parameter 
which display entire freedom available
in creating correct structured programs
