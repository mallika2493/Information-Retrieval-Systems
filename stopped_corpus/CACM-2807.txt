the stability gauss-jordan algorithm
with partial pivoting solution general 
systems linear equations commonly regarded suspect 
 shown respects suspicions 
are unfounded general absolute error solution
is strictly comparable 
to gaussian elimination partial pivoting back
substitution ill conditioned 
the residual gauss-jordan solution
will greater 
to gaussian elimination solution
