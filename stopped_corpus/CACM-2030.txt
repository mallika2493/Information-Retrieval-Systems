this paper presents canonical form context-sensitive
derivations parsing algorithm finds
each context-sensitive analysis amount memory
required algorithm essentially required 
store single complete derivation addition modified
version basic algorithm presented blocks infinite analyses 
for grammars loops algorithm is
also compared previous parsers context-sensitive
grammars general rewriting systems difference between
the types analyses discussed algorithm appears to
be complementary algorithm kuno respects including 
the space-time trade-off degree context dependence involved
