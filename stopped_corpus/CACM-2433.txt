as part effort design implement
a fortran compiler illiac iv extended 
fortran called ivtran developed language
provides means expressing data control 
structures suitable exploiting illiac iv parallelism 
 paper reviews hardware characteristics 
of illiac singles unconventional features
which expected influence language 
compiler design implications features for
data layout algorithm structure discussed 
and conclusion drawn data allocation than
