this paper concerned aspects contention
for main memory resources multiprogrammed 
computer system operating demand paging in
the model presented number page-frames 
main memory allocated problem program varies in
time memory configuration 
represented explicitly model cpu requirements and
page exception characteristics program material 
being statistically expressions distribution
of number page-frames allocated 
to executing program long run expected fraction
of program execution time number 
of page-frames average execution interval the
multiprogrammed load obtained pointed 
out heuristically demonstrated numerically that
an increase obtain able average execution 
interval multiprogrammed load resulting
from equal fixed partitioning main memory
