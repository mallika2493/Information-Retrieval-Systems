interactive skeleton techniques enhancing
motion dynamics key frame animation

a significant increase capability for
controlling motion dynamics key frame animation 
is achieved skeleton control technique
allows animator develop complex motion 
sequence animating stick figure representation
of image control sequence 
to drive image sequence movement 
 simplicity stick figure image encourages 
a high level interaction design stage 
its compatibility basic key frame animation 
technique permits skeleton control applied selectively
to components composite 
image sequence require enhancement
