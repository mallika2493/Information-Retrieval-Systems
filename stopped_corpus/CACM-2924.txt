an interactive computer graphics approach surface representation

an teractive computer graphics method been
developed rapid generation arbitrary 
shaped three-dimensional surfaces method synthesis
of spline theory algorithms teractive 
means man-machine communication software for
static dynamic graphics display basic 
technique employed modified lofting method on
which sectional curves represented uniform 
b-splines surface terpolated sections
by cardinal splines features 
this method algorithms enable teractive
modification b-spline representation 
sectional curves stages process the
spatial information graphically displayed 
the user complex surfaces created combination
of number shapes separately 
generated joined system been
successfully terfaced variety analytical 
routines structural medical graphical applications
