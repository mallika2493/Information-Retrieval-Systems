in computer operating systems user authenticates
himself entering secret password

table authentication
program integrity system depends 
keeping table secret paper password
scheme presented require secrecy 
in computer aspects system including
all relevant code data bases known 
by attempting intrude scheme based
on function would-be intruder 
is unable invert function applied the
user password result compared table 
entry match interpreted authentication of
the user intruder know 
have access table penetrate system
only invert determine input 
that produces output paper discusses
issues surrounding selection suitable 
different plausible arguments penetration
would exceedingly difficult 
argued rigorous results unlikely finally 
some human engineering problems relating 
the scheme discussed
