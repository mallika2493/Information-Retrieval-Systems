a fast method solving class tridiagonal linear systems

the solution linear systems real symmetric 
diagonally dominant tridiagonal coefficient 
matrices constant diagonals considered is
proved diagonals lu decomposition 
converges floating-point precision also
proved computed lu decomposition converges 
when floating-point arithmetic limits
of lu diagonals floating point 
roughly machine precision limits using
real arithmetic fact exploited reduce 
the number floating-point operations required to
solve linear system 8n-7 5n 2k-3 
k order matrix the
elements subdiagonals superdiagonals 
are 1 4n 2k-3 operations needed the
entire lu decomposition takes words storage 
and considerable savings array subscripting achieved 
 upper lower bounds obtained 
in terms ratio coefficient matrix diagonal
constants parameters floating-point 
number system generalizations results discussed
