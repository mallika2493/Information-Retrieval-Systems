a highly parallel algorithm approximating
all zeros polynomial real zeros

an algorithm based newton s
method simultaneously approximates zeros 
of polynomial real zeros algorithm which
is conceptually suitable parallel computation 
determines starting values convergence
to zeros guaranteed multiple zeros 
their multiplicity readily determined no
point method polynomial deflation
