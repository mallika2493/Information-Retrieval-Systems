the ease programming tabular method analysis
of variance complete factorial experiments 
in fortran language demonstrated method 
the total sum squares partitioned 
orthogonal single degree freedom sums squares 
main effect interaction sums squares 
then obtained pooling single degree
of freedom sums squares program segments 
to accomplish procedure presented modifications
to handle hierarchical designs replicated 
experiments mentioned fortran ii program
