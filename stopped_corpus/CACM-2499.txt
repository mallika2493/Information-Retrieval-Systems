although thought component
of time-sharing operation multiprogramming 
can involve broader questions resource allocation 
since fairness required meet response 
criterion multiprogrammed system serve
maximal resource unfair 
by holding input output channel idle program
while completes small amount processor 
usage enabling channel several
applications principle 
is suggested multiprogramming executive might
dynamically adjust allocation algorithms 
gain efficiency allocation resources closely connected
to accounting resources raising 
the problems repeatability minimal uncharged overhead 
and relative weighting charges dependent 
resources weightings depend allocation
algorithms arbitrary accounting 
parameters repeatable accounting is
one omits extensive overhead paid 
and multiprogramming prove efficient overcharges
will result multiprogramming turns allocation 
of memory resource essential control other
resources general suggestions allocation 
and accounting applied question some
details provided case monitor 
controls virtual-memory machine
