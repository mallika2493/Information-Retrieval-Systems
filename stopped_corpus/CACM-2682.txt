a general method constructing drive workload
representative real workload 
the real workload characterized demands the
various system resources characteristics 
of real workload obtained system accounting
data characteristics drive workload 
are determined matching joint probability density
of real workload drive 
workload drive workload realized a
synthetic program characteristics 
be varied varying parameters calibration
experiments conducted determine expressions 
relating synthetic program parameters workload
characteristics general method applied 
to case variables cpu seconds number
of activities synthetic workload 88 
jobs constructed represent month s
