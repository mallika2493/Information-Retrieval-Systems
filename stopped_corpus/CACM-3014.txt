assertions proving program correctness 

this paper explores technique proving the
correctness termination programs simultaneously 
 approach intermittent-assertion method involves
documenting program assertions 
must true time control passes through
the point need true 
every time method introduced burstall promises
to provide valuable complement 
conventional methods intermittent-assertion method
is presented number examples correctness 
and termination proofs proofs markedly
simpler conventional counterparts 
 hand shown proof correctness
or termination conventional 
techniques rephrased directly proof using
intermittent assertions finally shown 
how intermittent-assertion method applied
to prove validity program transformations 
and correctness continuously operating programs
