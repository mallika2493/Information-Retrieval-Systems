a case study programming parallel-processors

an affirmative partial answer provided to
the question program 
parallel-processor computing systems efficiently decrease
execution time problems parallel-processor 
systems multiprocessor systems of
the processors simultaneously execute separate 
tasks single job cooperating decrease
the solution time computational problem 
processors independent instruction counters meaning
that processor executes task program 
relatively independently processors communication
between cooperating processors 
means data storage shared processors a
program determination distribution 
of electrical network written a
parallel-processor computing system execution 
of program simulated data gathered from
simulation runs demonstrate efficient solution 
of problem typical large class important
problems shown proper programming 
solution time processors applied approaches
1 times solution time single processor 
while improper programming actually lead increase
of solution time number processors 
 stability method solution investigated
