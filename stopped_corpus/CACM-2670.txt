algorithm nonlinear squares problems

nonlinear squares frequently arise which
the variables solved separated 
into linear nonlinear part variable projection
algorithm developed recently 
is designed take advantage structure problem
whose variables separate 
paper slightly efficient slightly more
general version algorithm appeared 
earlier
