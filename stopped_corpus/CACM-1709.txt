a modification efroymson technique stepwise regression analysis

the computational technique conventionally used
for stepwise multiple linear regression requires 
the storage matrix data number
of variables large requirement 
taxes storage capacity presently machinery 
 symmetry matrices involved permits 
a modification requiring half storage computations
of conventional algorithm 
additional storage analysis problems containing
more variables alternatively permits 
the analysis problems number
of variables computations performed 
in double precision
