for purposes paper block-transfer
ccd memory composed serial shift registers 
whose shift rate vary definite minimum
shift rate refresh rate definite 
maximum shift rate bits iin shift registers
are numbered 0 - 1 blocks bits 
always transferred starting bit 0 what
is shift strategy block transfer 
request occurring random time wait the
minimal amount time bit 0 reached 
 minimum shift rate requirement allow one
to simply park bit 0 wait transfer 
request optimal strategy involves shifting slowly
as bit 0 passed shifting 
as quickly critical boundary is
reached shortly bit 0 comes 
 called hurry wait strategy well
