in 1974 catmull developed algorithm
for rendering images bivariate surface patches 
 paper describes extensions algorithm in
the areas texture simulation lighting models 
 parameterization patch defines coordinate

algorithm accurate computation 
the surface normal patch picture element 
permitting simulation mirror reflections
