although encipherment discussed
as means protect computer data costs 
are established experiments conducted
to measure cpu time cdc 6400 required 
by additive ciphers programmed assembly language
and fortran null transformation measure 
the time move data encipherment encipherment
with one-word key encipherment 125-word 
key double key encipherment encipherment using
a pseudo random key results analyzed 
for consistency 100 runs effects constant
and intermittent errors considered 
timing rates assembly language encipherment ranged
from 498,800 characters pseudo 
random key cipher 2,092,000 characters second
for constant one-word key cipher 
is equivalent rate required simply move
data encipherment fortran tests required 
over times cpu time paper introduces
the idea enciphering time coefficient 
ratio enciphering time time to
fetch store data encipherment
