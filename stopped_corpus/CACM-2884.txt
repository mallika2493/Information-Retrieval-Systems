permutation enumeration permutation algorithms

classical permutation enumeration algorithms encounter
special cases requiring additional computation 
every nth permutation generating permutations
on marks algorithms attribute 
that special cases occur n-1 permutations 
two algorithms produce permutation 
with single exchange marks algorithms
infrequently exchange marks 
but rules generating permutation are
very simple performance tests counted 
execution assignment statements comparisons arithmetic
operations subscripted array references 
have shown superiority algorithms compared to
boothroyd implementation algorithm 
and ehrlich implementation johnson-trotter algorithm
