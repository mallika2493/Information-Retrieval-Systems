to sequential pattern recognition

a sequential pattern recognition spr procedure
does test features pattern 
at selects feature tested after
receiving result test procedure 
either classifies unknown pattern selects another
feature tested medical diagnosis 
is spr paper authors suggest
that spr viewed one-person game played 
against nature chance virtually powerful techniques
developed searching two-person strictly 
competitive game trees easily incorporated either
directly analogy spr procedures 
 incorporate mini average
backing-up procedure gamma procedure 
which analogues minimax backing-up procedure 
and alpha-beta procedure 
 computer simulated experiments character recognition
are presented results 
the approach promising
