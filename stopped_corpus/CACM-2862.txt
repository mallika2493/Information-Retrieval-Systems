analysis pff replacement algorithm semi-markov model

an analytical model presented estimate
the performance page fault frequency pff 
replacement algorithm model program behavior
is represented lru stack distance model 
and pff replacement algorithm represented semi-markov
model models parameters 
as inter-page-fault interval distribution the
probability number distinct pages 
referenced inter-page-fault interval are
able analytically determined 
models evaluate parameter values permits study
of performance replacement algorithm 
by simulating page fault events every
page reference event significantly reduces 
the required computation time estimating
the performance pff algorithm
