an algorithm determining near-optimal
computation order matrix chain products

this paper discusses computation matrix
chain products form m1 m2 mn 
where mi matrices order matrices
are computed affects number operations 
 sufficient condition association the
matrices optimal order presented 
o algorithm find order computation which
takes 25 percent longer optimal 
time topt presented cases algorithm
yields optimal order order 
takes percent longer topt 1 percent average
