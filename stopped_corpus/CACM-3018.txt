keyword conflicts intersection graphs

kellerman presented method determining
keyword conflicts heuristic 
algorithm solves combinatorial optimization
problem connection method 
this optimization problem shown equivalent
to problem covering edges graph 
by complete subgraphs objective minimizing
the number complete subgraphs relationship 
between edge-clique-cover problem graph coloring
problem established algorithms 
for problems constructed
from algorithm consequences 
this relationship keyword conflict problem the
edge-clique-cover problem shown np-complete 
and np admit polynomial-time approximation
algorithms produce solutions 
within factor 2 optimum
