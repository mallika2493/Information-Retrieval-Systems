this paper develops multidimensional binary
search tree k-d tree dimensionality 
of search space data structure storage of
information retrieved associative searches 
the k-d tree defined examples it
is shown storage requirements 
 significant advantage structure single
data structure handle types queries 
very efficiently utility algorithms developed 
their proven average running times 
n record insertion log deletion of
the root k-1 deletion random node 
o log optimization guarantees logarithmic performance
of searches log search algorithms 
are partial match queries keys specified
 
and nearest neighbor queries empirically observed average
running time log performances 
far surpass known algorithms for
these tasks algorithm presented handle 
any general intersection query main focus this
paper theoretical felt 
k-d trees applications
