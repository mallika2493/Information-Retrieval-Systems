sequencing minimize mean finishing time
 mean time system desirable 
the user tends minimize point
in time storage required hold incomplete 
tasks paper deterministic model independent
tasks introduced results derived 
which extend generalize algorithms known for
minimizing mean finishing time addition 
presenting analyzing algorithms shown
that general mean-finishing-time problem 
for independent tasks polynomial complete unlikely
to admit non-enumerative solution
