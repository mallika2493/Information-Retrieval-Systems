a cost oriented algorithm data set allocation storage hierarchies

data set allocation today multilevel
storage systems based qualitative 
ad hoc decisions desirable obtain
an optimal solution allocation problem 
it clear number parameters involved makes
it intractable straight-forward solution 
 situation find set assumptions
which simplify problem greatly 
still provide basis considering significant
cost elements paper presents 
quantitative allocation step considers the
significant detailed costs system utilization 
data storage data staging data migration although
many avenues improvement 
the present algorithm usefully accurate 
as aid quantifying problems 
of data set allocation storage system configuration device designs
