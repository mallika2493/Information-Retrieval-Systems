a simulation model time-sharing system
with finite noncontiguous store infinite 
auxiliary store study variation system
parameters store size number jobs 
allowed execute simultaneously job-scheduling algorithm 
etc effects variations 
a measure system performance ascertain which
of parameters controllable job-scheduling 
algorithm including scheduling require optimization 
and parameters 
controllable scheduling algorithm marked
effect system performance system performance 
is based mean cost delay jobs processed 
 shown significant improvements 
in measure system performance obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time appears these
features benefit optimization 
other parameters controllable scheduling algorithm
affect system performance predictable 
manner benefit optimization features
not control scheduling 
algorithm marked effect measure
of performance supervisor overheads 
the size store speed cpu comparison
is made results simulation 
model analytical equations quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems comparison 
is found favorable
