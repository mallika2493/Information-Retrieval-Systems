a parametric algorithm drawing pictures
of solid objects composed quadric surfaces

an algorithm drawing pictures three-dimensional
objects surfaces made patches 
of quadric surfaces emphasis of
this algorithm calculating intersections 
of quadric surfaces parameterization scheme 
 quadric surface intersection curve qsic 
is represented set coefficients parameter
limits parameter represents 
at points easily distinguished 
 scheme find coordinates points 
of quartic fourth-order intersection curves using
equations order methods 
of parameterization type osic discussed 
as surface bounding hidden surface
