display system designers faced the
difficult task selecting major subsystems 
an intelligent subsystem chosen large
numbers alternatives selection based 
on considerations system response time system
cost distribution data storage 
processing graphics processor supporting
data processing system work reported 
here develops objective quantitative design procedure
and helps give understanding 
to configure display systems accomplished by
means mathematical model computer driven 
graphics system parameters model functions
of capabilities graphics hardware 
and computational requirements graphics application 
 model analyzed numerical 
queueing analysis simulation obtain average
response time prediction combining model 
with optimization graphics system configuration 
subject cost constraint found 
for applications optimum configurations
are turn find general display system
