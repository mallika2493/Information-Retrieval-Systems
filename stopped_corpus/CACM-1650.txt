analysis complete factorial experiments

a computational method for
the calculation sums squares analysis 
of variance complete factorial experiments in
the computation main effect interaction means 
is method elucidated unifying since
one method variety purposes 
each previously requiring methods programming
advantages method obvious 
 variants discussed 1 standard
analysis variance 2 analyses omitting 
levels factors 3 separate analyses
for levels factor combinations 
of levels factor performed
simultaneously 4 calculation main effect 
or interaction means mean expects data standard
order leaves data order 
so analyses data performed
without rearrangement total sum squares 
excluding replication sum squares partitioned
into polynomial partitions interactions 
each degree freedom even
if factors unequally spaced factor levels
