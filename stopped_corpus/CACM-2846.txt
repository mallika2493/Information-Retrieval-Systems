compressed tries

this paper presents data structure 
called compressed trie c-trie 
information retrieval systems underlying
m-ary tree structure trie 
a parameter trie fields the
nodes trie large hold 
a key pointer fields c-trie are
only bit long analysis part 
paper shown collection keys the
retrieval time measured terms bit inspections 
of key order logm storage
requirement order log2 bits 
improvement storage requirements retrieval time
is achieved cost decreasing flexibility 
of structure updating costs increased 
 c-trie analyzed data 
structure methods use
for static databases discussed
