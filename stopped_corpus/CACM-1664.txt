an algorithm deriving equations of
mathematical physics symbolic manipulation

a method digital computer
can derive equations mathematical 
physics curvilinear coordinate system requested
by user effectiveness technique 
is demonstrated derive navier-stokes
equations fluid motion continuity 
equation derive equations method the
user need know coordinate transformation 
equations relating curvilinear coordinates interest
to orthogonal cartesian triad 
program coordinate transformation equations
are supplied input computer 
derive navier-stokes equations continuity
equation equations obtained relative 
to curvilinear coordinate system the
transformation equations input 
paper emphasis theoretical considerations and
methodology programming details 
 results presented cylindrical polar
and spherical polar coordinate systems
