an optimal insertion algorithm one-sided
height-balanced binary search trees

an algorithm inserting element one-sided height-balanced
 oshb binary search tree presented algorithm operates time 
o log number nodes in
the tree represents improvement previous
ly known insertion algorithms hirschberg kosaraju require
time log 2n log complexity optimal earlier 
results shown deletion structure can
also performed log time result paper
gives negative answer question trees should
be examples kind deletion smaller time 
complexity insertion concluded
that insertion deletion retrieval oshb trees can
be performed time operations for
the general avl trees constant factor 
the insertion deletion algorithms oshb trees much
more complicated algorithms avl trees
