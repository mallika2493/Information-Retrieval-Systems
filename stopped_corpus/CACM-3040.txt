synthesizing constraint expressions

a constraint network representation presented
for combinatorial search problem finding 
values set variables subject set constraints 
 theory consistency levels 
networks formulated related problems
of backtrack tree search efficiency algorithm 
is developed achieve level consistency
desired order preprocess problem 
subsequent backtrack search function alternative
to backtrack search explicitly determining 
all solutions
