computer methods sampling from
the exponential normal distributions

various methods known transforming uniformly
distributed random numbers exponentially
and distributed quantities efficient
ones compared terms memory requirements 
and speed algorithms number procedures
convert taylor series expansions directly 
into sampling steps approach for
sampling continuous distribution 
the exponential distribution definite recommendation
can made case normal 
distribution remains choice slower and
shorter algorithms faster space consuming
