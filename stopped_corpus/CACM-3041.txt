split trees technique searching sets
of keys highly skewed frequency distributions 
 split tree binary search tree node which
contains key values-a node 
a maximally frequent key subtree split
value partitions remaining keys 
respect lexical ordering left and
right subtrees median split tree mst 
the lexical median node descendents split
value force search tree perfectly 
balanced achieving space efficient representation
of tree high search speed unlike 
frequency ordered binary search trees cost a
successful search mst log bounded 
very stable minimal values mst
can built key ordering set 
frequencies time log opposed n2 an
optimum binary search tree discussion 
application mst dictionary lookup english is
presented performance obtained contrasted 
with techniques
