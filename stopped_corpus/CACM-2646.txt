this paper presents background algorithms
for masking rotational latency disk 
or drum discusses anticipatory input output
of blocks data buffer primary memories 
for mono-programmed computer system basic permutation
algorithm variations 
 anticipatory nature scheduling 
these algorithms restricted classes 
of programs predictable behavior methods
are restricted numerical computations 
matrix partial differential equation methods are
typical examples shown 
latency masked small amount buffer
memory methods discussed independent 
the size data base considered
