use lru stack depth distribution
for simulation paging behavior

two families probability distributions were
needed virtual memory simulation 
model headway page fault distributions and
working set size distributions members 
both families derived lru stack depth distribution 
 simple expressions computation 
of kinds distributions finally examples
are families distributions 
as computed published stack depth distribution
