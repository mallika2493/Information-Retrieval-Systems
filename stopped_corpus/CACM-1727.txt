for segmentation program useful
to reasonable estimation values 
of ij ij mean number
of jumps i-th instruction j-th 
instruction run time cases the
s ij estimated directly structure 
whole program generally account 
therefore difficult programmer 
and translator obtain good estimation of
the ij easier estimate ij 
the quantities ij ij sum where
c arbitrary positive constant 
i ij proportional to
s ij estimation ij easier 
we estimate probabilities events
where instruction executed instruction 
i estimation considering
the structure program 
the part paper theory the
markov chains algorithm computation 
of ij ij found ways
of obtaining estimates ij 
the part variant algorithm derived 
avoiding necessity computation involving 
large matrices
