an algorithm presented searches for
the location occurrence 
character string pat string string 
 search operation characters 
pat matched starting character of
pat information gained starting match 
at end pattern algorithm
to proceed large jumps text 
searched algorithm unusual property 
in cases characters 
of string inspected number characters actually
inspected average decreases 
function length pat random english
pattern length 5 algorithm typically 
inspect 4 characters string finding match at
i algorithm implemented 
so average fewer patlen machine
instructions executed conclusions
