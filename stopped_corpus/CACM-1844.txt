a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach design organization
of general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system presented system organization described
is conceptually simple arrangement 
of bank interchangeable computers which
is memory processor pair assigned 
process terminal jobs arrive computers
serves master control computer 
and supervises collection distribution messages
from remote terminals 
simplest form disk drive connected
terminal crosspoint switching network 
any disk drive connected computer 
 active terminal user occupies 
a dedicated disk drive share computer with
many terminal users simple manner 
 ratio users computers dependent both
the size power machines 
computation requirements mix users 
 system organization inherently simpler 
and reliable approach time-sharing computers
and potential highly 
system low cost economic configurations
are range systems sizes 
span order magnitude finally problem
programs developed remote terminal users 
be run dedicated batch system compatible computers
