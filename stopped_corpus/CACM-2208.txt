assignment performed hashing algorithm

the utilization storage studied two-level
memory hierarchy storage level 
which fast store divided number of
storage areas entry filed 
the hierarchy hashing algorithm attempt to
place entry areas 
particular area full entry placed
into slower second-level store 
other areas first-level store space
available entries filed 
the entire hierarchy expression derived the
expected number entries filed first-level 
storehis expression measure effectively
the first-level store means 
of examples storage utilization studied a
function hashing algorithm number 
storage areas first-level store divided
and total size first-level store
