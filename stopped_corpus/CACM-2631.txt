an information-theoretic approach to
text searching direct access systems

using direct access computer bibliographic
information attempt made overcome 
one problems information
retrieval maintenance large 
dictionaries greater part only
infrequently method presented 
maps hyperbolic frequency distribution is
more suited implementation storage devices 
 method treats text string characters rather
than words bounded spaces chooses subsets 
of strings frequencies occurrence are
more word types members 
of subset index keys retrieval 
the rectangular distribution key frequencies 
results simplified organization
and promises considerable cost advantages
