this article investigates application of
minimal-total-processing-time mtpt scheduling 
disciplines rotating storage units random arrival
of requests allowed fixed-head drum 
moving-head drum moving-head disk storage units are
considered emphasis relative 
merits mtpt scheduling discipline respect
to shortest-latency-time-first sltf scheduling 
discipline results simulation studies
presented show scheduling discipline 
is unconditionally superior most
fixed-head drum applications sltf discipline 
is preferable mtpt intra-cylinder disk scheduling
the mtpt discipline offers distinct advantage 
over sltf discipline computational requirements
of algorithm implements mtpt scheduling 
discipline shown comparable sltf algorithms 
in cases sorting procedure 
most time-consuming phase algorithm
