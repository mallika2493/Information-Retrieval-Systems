how addresses short

an algorithm presented minimizing the
sum lengths blocks coding produced 
by assembler compiler 1 length of
each computer instruction assumed 
 long short long memory location addressed
is predetermined distance 
the location short 2 
there blocks instructions beginnings 
 origins separated prespecified amounts 
some computers permit 8-bit addressing 
 interpreted relative location counter full
16-bit addressing memory assembling 
or compiling blocks instructions which
have mutual references computer 
there simple iterative procedure keeping
as addresses short 
paper demonstrates wide class problems of
this type formulated covering problems 
solvable means elementary arithmetic operations
on column vectors ternary matrix
