new sufficient optimality conditions for
integer programming application

the purpose report present a
new class sufficient optimality conditions 
pure mixed integer programming problems of
the sets sufficient conditions presented 
be thought generalizations optimality conditions
based primal-dual complementarity linear 
programming sufficient conditions particularly
useful construction difficult integer 
programming problems known optimal solutions these
problems test benchmark
