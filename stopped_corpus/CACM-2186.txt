in paper ritz-trefftz algorithm applied
to computer solution state regulator 
problem algorithm represents modification of
the ritz direct method designed improve 
the speed solution storage requirements to
the point real-time implementation 
feasible modification shown stable
computationally traditional ritz approach 
 concern paper describe the

to determine feedback matrix technique is
shown significantly faster comparable
