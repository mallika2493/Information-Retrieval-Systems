the problem recovering image function
of variables experimentally 
integrals grayness thin strips great
importance large number scientific areas 
 important version problem medicine is
that obtaining exact density distribution 
within human body x-ray projectionsne approach
that solve problem 
consists translating information into
a system linear inequalities size 
the sparsity resulting system typically 25,000
inequalities fewer 1 percent 
coefficients nonzero makes methods successive
relaxations computationally attractive compared 
to ways solving systems inequalities 
in paper shown consistent 
system linear inequalities sequence relaxarion parameters
lying strictly 0 2 generates 
a sequence vectors converges solution 
 assumptions system linear 
equations relaxation method converges minimum
norm solution previously proposed techniques
are shown special cases procedure with
different choices relaxation parameters 
practical consequences image reconstruction the
choice relaxation parameters discussed
