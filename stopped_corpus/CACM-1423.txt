a simple algorithm computing generalized inverse matrix

the generalized inverse matrix important
in analysis extension 
of concept inverse applies matrices 
 applications numerical 
analysis widely existing
algorithms fairly complicated require 
considerable storage space simple extension has
been found conventional orthogonalization 
method inverting non-singular matrices gives
the generalized inverse extra effort 
and additional storage requirements algorithm
gives generalized inverse 
n matrix including special case a
is non-singular case rank 
 case algorithm ordinary
inverse case algorithm 
yields ordinary squares transformation matrix
inv advantage avoiding 
the loss significance results forming product explicitly
