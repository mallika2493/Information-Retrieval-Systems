n-dimensional codes detecting correcting multiple errors

the paper introduces family codes
for detecting correcting multiple errors 
a binary-coded message message arranged
 conceptually multidimensional rectangular 
array processes encoding error detection
are based parity evaluations prescribed 
dimensions array effectiveness codes
is increased introducing system check bit 
which essentially parity check parity
bits three-dimensional codes discussed 
in paper parity evaluations horizontal 
the vertical main diagonal 
the family codes restricted dimensions 
as evidenced discussion minnick 
and ashenhurst similar multidimensional single-bit
selection plan purpose 
 four-dimensional code correcting detecting
four errors developed extension 
to higher-dimensional codes greater correction power straightforward
