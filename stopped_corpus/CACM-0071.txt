be capable preparing programs variety
of machines characteristics similar 
of facility computer basic assumptions
is random-access 
storage avoid necessity segmenting
a constructed program fashion 
a trivial assumption unrealistic 
it intended provide opportunity 
to concentrate aspects program construction
