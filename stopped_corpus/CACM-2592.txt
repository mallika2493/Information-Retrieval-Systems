users linear programming computer codes have
realized necessity evaluating capacity 
effectiveness accuracy solutions provided
by codes large scale linear programming 
codes installations assumed generating correct
solutions bench-marked 
by test problems known solutions reason for
this failure adequately test codes 
rarely large problems known solutions readily
available paper presents theoretical 
justification illustrative implementation method
for generating linear programming test problems 
with known solutions method permits generation
of test problems arbitrary size 
and wide range numerical characteristics
