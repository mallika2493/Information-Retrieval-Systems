a technique recognizing systems lines
is presented technique heuristic 
of problem embedded recognition algorithm
but expressed figure merit 
a multistage decision process able recognize
in input picture optimal system lines 
according figure merit due the
global approach greater flexibility adequacy 
in problem achieved relation
between structure figure merit 
the complexity optimization process discussed 
 method suitable parallel 
processing operations relative each
state computed parallel number
of stages equal length curves or
to log2 approximate method
