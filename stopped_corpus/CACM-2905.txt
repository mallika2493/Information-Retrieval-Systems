probe retrieving method static sets

a refinement hashing retrieval
of item static table single probe 
is considered set identifiers methods
are presented building mechanical 
way perfect hashing functions functions transforming
the elements unique addresses 
 method quotient reduction method is
shown complete sense 
set smallest table elements i
can stored retrieved 
by perfect hashing function constructed this
method found nonuniformly 
distributed sets method give sparse tables 
 method remainder reduction 
method complete sense seems
to give minimal minimal tables 
every kind set techniques applicable
directly small sets methods extend 
these results larger sets presented rough
comparison ordinary hashing 
shows method conveniently
in practical applications
