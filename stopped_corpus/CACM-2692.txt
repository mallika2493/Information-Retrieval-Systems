reentrant polygon clipping

a family clipping algorithms 
 algorithms able clip polygons 
against irregular convex plane-faced volumes three
dimensions removing parts polygon 
lie volume dimensions algorithms
permit clipping irregular convex windows 
 polygons clipped represented ordered
sequence vertices repetition 
and marked contrast representation a
collection edges heretofore common 
procedure output polygons identical format 
with vertices introduced sequence describe 
any newly-cut edge edges algorithms easily handle
the difficult problem detecting 
that vertex required corner the
clipping window algorithms achieve 
considerable simplicity clipping separately against
each clipping plane window boundary code 
capable clipping polygon single boundary
is reentered clip subsequent boundaries 
 reentrant stage clipping need store only
two vertex values begin processing 
as soon output vertex proceeding
stage ready code reentered 
for clipping subsequent boundaries clipping
against complex window shapes practical 
 perspective applications dimentions six-plane
truncated pyramid chosen clipping 
volume additional planes parallel projection
screen serve limit range depth 
preserved projection perspective projection
method arbitrary view 
angles depth field spite simple fixed clipping
planes method ideal 
for subsequent hidden-surface computations
