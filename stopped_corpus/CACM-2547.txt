a computer-searchable representation
for basic pictorial features contour 
maps region coverage line structures 
 representation practical storage 
requirements rapid mean searching large
files data geometric position 
as attribute application this
representation handling terrain information 
illustrates utility algebraic properties
of data structure make computationally easy 
to determine point lies closed boundary 
compute area contained closed boundary 
generate closed boundary representing union or
intersection closed boundaries determine 
the neighboring boundaries point the
minimum distances point
