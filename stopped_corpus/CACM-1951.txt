for computer communications traffic models

a study multiaccess computer communications has
characterized distributions underlying elementary
 model user-computer interactive process model is
elementary sense random variables that
generally interest computer communications studies be
decomposed elements model data examined
from operational multiaccess systems model shown to
be robust variables model the
same distribution independent systems examined 
it shown gamma distribution to
describe discrete variables approximations gamma distribution
by exponential distribution discussed systems studied
