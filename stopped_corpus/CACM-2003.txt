an interactive software system computers-aided
design application circuit project

the characteristics interactive software system intended constitute 
an interface designer computer steps of
the design process presented main emphasis the
description features high level user oriented
languages operating levels interaction
is based imol interactive monitor language 
which designed perform control functions
of software system design criteria provide user with
commands simple efficient order perform all
the functions needed computer-aided circuit design 
coif circuit oriented graphic language designed
to describe generate manipulate graphic problem specifications 
it extension fortran graphic-type variables 
so designer familiar fortran need learn 
language application computer-aided circuit design
is examined hand adopted design
criteria provide sufficient generality extend languages 
to computer-assisted applications
