central solutions pattern classification

in two-class pattern recognition standard
technique algorithm finding hyperplanes
which separates classes linearly separable training
set traditional methods find hyperplane separates all
points hyperplane necessarily centered
in empty space classes central
hyperplane favor class have
a lower error rate classifying points better
than noncentral hyperplane algorithms finding central
hyperplanes tested data sets frequently
used practice modified relaxation algorithm poor 
three algorithms defined paper found be
quite good
