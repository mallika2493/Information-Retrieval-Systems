a method presented determining which
parts three-dimensional objects visible 
which invisible objects rotated about
some axis paper describes polygon comparison 
scheme relationships polygons can
be classified tree types discusses 
how relationship changed pair polygons
under rotation axis rotation 
table defined pair polygons remains
fixed long rotation axis 
and means rapidly determining visible
and hidden line relationship polygons 
 additional work extend approach
to simultaneous rotation axes
