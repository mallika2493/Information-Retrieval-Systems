an exponential method solution of
systems ordinary differential equations 

an explicit coupled single-step method for
the numerical solution initial problems 
for systems ordinary differential equations presented 
 method designed general purpose 
in nature especially efficient dealing
with stiff systems differential equations 
it general order case
of linear system constant coefficients 
linear forcing terms case method third
order implemented put routine 
usage biological applications-where stiffness frequently
appears-with favorable results compared 
to standard fourth order runge-kutta implementation 
computation time required method ranged 
from comparable nonstiff problems better
than orders magnitude faster 
highly stiff systems
