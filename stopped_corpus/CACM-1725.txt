theorem associative memories

an efficient method ordered retrieval binary
words associative memory described
by lewin based special readout circuits
which digit values present 
the individual digit columns memory the
circuits individual digit 
columns digits values one
value digits 
memory empty circuits which
in paper termed column indicators 
reduces considerably number memory accesses necessary
to retrieve order number distinct 
words memory lewin proves readout
by method distinct binary 
words 2m - 1 memory accesses he
proves number memory accesses 
of method unlike methods independent
of word length paper
