a code specifically designed simplify
the internal information processing operations 
within online computer system respect non-numeric
applications maximize transfer 
rate information channel linking system and
the system user code direct application 
to problems area information retrieval document
classification computer-aided teaching 
text editing code called ipc information processing
code 8-bit code set constructed 
so 7 6 5 4-bit subsets easily derived
from basic set code set organized 
so simple binary operations distinguish between
the numeric alphabetic special symbol control 
character codes number usable characters within
the basic set size expanded 
use escape codes included set suitable
interpretation unassigned codes 
on basis requirements local environments
