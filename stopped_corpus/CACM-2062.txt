the application sequential sampling
to simulation inventory model

four sequential sampling procedures applied
to analysis data generated computer simulation
experiment multi-item inventory model procedure
the cost computer time required achieve levels of
statistical precision calculated cost computer time
using comparable fixed sample size methods calculated the
computer costs fixed sample size procedures versus
sequential sampling procedures compared
