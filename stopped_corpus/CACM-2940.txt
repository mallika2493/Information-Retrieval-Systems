and iteration generators

the alphard form programmer with
a great deal control implementation 
of abstract data types paper abstraction techniques
are extended simple data representation 
and function definition iteration statement the
most important poin interaction data 
and control structure language a
means specializing alphard loops operate 
on abstract entities explicit dependence the
representation entities troduced 
 specification verification techniques allow
the properties generators iterations 
to expressed form proof rules developed 
 results obtained common special 
cases loops essentially identical the
corresponding constructs languages 
means showing generator terminate provided
