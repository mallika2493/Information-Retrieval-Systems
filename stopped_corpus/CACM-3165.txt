the approximation polygonal thematic maps cellular
maps important operation geographical data processing 
is analyzed data organization representing polygonal
maps widely segment-based data structure class
labels identify regions bordering segment side 
the approximation algorithm presented operates an
organization eliminating need recognition region boundaries 
each segment examined versatility of
the organization illustrated outline algorithms
for area computation point inclusion algorithm is
applied set soil maps converted computer-readable
