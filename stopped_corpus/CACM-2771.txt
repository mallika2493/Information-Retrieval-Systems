the synthesis solids bounded faces

a technique presented class
of solid objects synthesized stored 
using computer synthesis begins primitive solids
like cube wedge cylinder solid 
can moved scaled rotated solids be
added subtracted algorithms 
perform addition practical designers 
the technique advantage operations 
are concise readily composed terms
of easily imagined solidsuite short sequences 
of operations suffice build complex solids bounded faces
