scan conversion algorithms cell organized raster display

raster scan computer graphics real time 
character generators previously limited 
to alphanumeric characters display described
which extends capabilities organization 
to include general graphics fundamentally different
scan conversion algorithms 
developed support display presented one
is suitable non-interactive applications 
and interactive applications algorithms
were implemented fortran cdc 6400 
computer results obtained implementations show
that noninteractive algorithms significantly 
reduce display storage requirements cost
in execution time conventional 
raster display interactive algorithm improve
response time reduce storage requirements
