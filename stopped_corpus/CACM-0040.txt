the binary number system offers advantages
over decimal representation high-performance 
general-purpose computer greater simplicity of
a binary arithmetic unit greater compactness 
of binary numbers contribute directly arithmetic
speed obvious important 
is binary addressing instruction formats can
increase performance binary addresses 
are essential powerful operations which
are practical decimal instruction formats 
 hand decimal numbers essential for
communicating man computer 
applications requiring processing large volume
of inherently decimal input output data 
the time decimal-binary conversion needed purely
binary computer significant slower 
decimal adder take time fast binary adder
doing addition conversions careful 
review significance decimal binary addressing
and binary decimal data arithmetic 
supplemented efficient conversion instructions
