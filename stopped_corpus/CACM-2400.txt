use hough transformation todetect lines curves pictures

hough proposed interesting computationally
efficient procedure detecting lines 
in pictures paper points angle-radius
rather slope-intercept parameters 
simplifies computation shows
how method general curve 
fitting alternative interpretations
that explain source efficiency
