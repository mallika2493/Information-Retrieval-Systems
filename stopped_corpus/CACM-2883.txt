this paper presents method detecting edges
and contours noisy pictures properties 
of edge embedded figure merit edge
detection problem problem minimizing 
the figure merit problem represented
as shortest path problem graph 
can solved well-known graph search algorithms 
 relations representation 
the minimization problem dynamic programming approach
are discussed showing graph search 
method lead substantial improvements computing
time heuristic search methods 
are computing time depend amount
of noise picture experimental results 
are show information the
shape contour object embedded
in figure merit allowing extraction
of contours noisy picture separation 
of touching objects
