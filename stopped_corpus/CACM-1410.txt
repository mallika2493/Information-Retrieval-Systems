time-sharing system tss input process 
is assumed stationary defined the
interarrival time distribution data obtained 
appear justify satisfactorily common assumption
that interarrival times serially independent 
 data justify very
rough approximation usual assumption 
exponential distribution interarrival time much
more satisfactory approximation data 
be obtained biphase triphase hyperexponential distribution
