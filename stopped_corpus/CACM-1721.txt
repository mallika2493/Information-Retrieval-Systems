determination intersection points two
plane curves means differential equations

a method proposed calculate intersection
points plane curves theory 
of singular points system differential equations
is developing method intersection 
point determined identified singular
point modifications applied 
to system ensure singular point stable 
i integrals start neighborhood 
of singular point approach point
if integral parameter tends infinity 
addition method systematically searching
for intersection points prescribed 
rectangular area
