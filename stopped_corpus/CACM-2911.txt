rule dynamic memory allocation

this paper reports simulation data showing
that dynamic memory allocation average 
free-to-allocated-block ratio differ considerably
and directions predictions 
the 50 percent rule derivation it
is shown previous derivations make assumption 
that violated frequently basis simulation
data derivation hypothesized 
that anomalous behavior results combined

of release process additional simulations support
this hypothesis systematic placement 
refers natural convention allocating
