storage-efficient representation decimal data

usually decimal digits represented by
4n bits computers actually bcd digits 
can compressed optimally reversibly 7 bits 
and digits 10 bits simple 
algorithm based fixed-length combination two
variable field-length encodings half 
of cases compressed code results conventional
bcd code simple removal redundant 
0 bits long decimal message subdivided into
three-digit blocks separately compressed 
the result differs asymptotic minimum length
by 0.34 percent hardware requirement 
is small mappings manually
