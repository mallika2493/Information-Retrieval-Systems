a comparative study made variety

data decay type forms involving sums of
exponentials statistical errors fitted 
parameters calculated methods been

procedure great care sensitive variations
in fitting procedure great 
care exercised identifying values with
physical constants values functions 
derived fitted parameters definitely

more stable variations fitting techniques 
error bounds large great confidence
