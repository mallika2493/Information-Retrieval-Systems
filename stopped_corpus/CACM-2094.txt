certain nonlinear minimax approximation problems characterize
d properties permit application special algorithms 
mainly based exchange algorithms remes 1934 1935 for
their solution paper application problems this
type general nonlinear algorithm due osborne watson
 1969 considered examples illustrate this
algorithm give satisfactory results can
successfully solve problems lead difficulties
with conventional specialist method
