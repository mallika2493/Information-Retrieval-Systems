this paper presents statistical results
of tests accuracy arithmetic 
systems evaluating sums products products 
and analytic error estimates 
computations arithmetic systems studied 6-digit
hexadecimal 22-digit binary floating point 
number representations combined usual chop
and round modes arithmetic numbers 
of guard digits modified round mode guard
digits sense arithmetic systems 
differing binary hexadecimal number
representations shown approximately 
statistically equivalent inaccuracy the
usual round mode guard digits shown 
statistically superior accuracy usual chop
mode cases save modified round 
mode found superior chop mode cases
