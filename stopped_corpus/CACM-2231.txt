the reconstruction binary patterns projections

given horizontal vertical projections
of finite binary pattern construct 
the original pattern paper give characterization
of patterns reconstructable 
from projection algorithms developed
to reconstruct unambiguous ambiguous 
patterns shown unambiguous pattern can
be perfectly reconstructed time 
a pattern similar ambiguous pattern constructed
in time dimensions 
of pattern frame
