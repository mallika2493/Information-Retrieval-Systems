the classical process partitioning array
into subarrays extended 
array language operation modes partitioning
are defined types arrays 
that subarrays vary original array in
a nearly arbitrary manner definitions 
motivated realistic examples illustrate
the partitioning array languages 
 general interest data structure partitioning 
 consists dynamic tree structures 
which derive maintain array control
information sufficient 
detail design array languages 
 description presented paper
