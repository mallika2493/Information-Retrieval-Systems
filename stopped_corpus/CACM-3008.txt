preserving average proximity arrays

programmers data structure designers often
forced choose alternative structures 
 storing structures preserving logical adjacencies
or proximity important consideration 
 combinatorial problem storing arrays various
kinds list structures examined embeddings 
of graphs model loss proximity involved
in storage schemes elementary 
proof arrays stored linear lists with
bounded loss proximity presented average 
loss proximity considered shown
that arrays stored linear lists 
only bounded loss average proximity so
stored binary trees result implies 
for instance row major order asymptotically
optimal storage strategy arrays
