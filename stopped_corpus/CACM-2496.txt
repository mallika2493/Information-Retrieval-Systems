drum scheduling discipline

for computer systems practical
to determine instantaneous drum position 
a popular discipline determining sequence which
the records accessed so-called 
shortest-latency-time-first sltf discipline when
a collection varying-length records 
accessed drum positions known that
the sltf discipline necessarily minimize 
the drum latency time show total
