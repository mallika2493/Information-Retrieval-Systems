an elementary outline theorem-proving
approach automatic program synthesis 
without dwelling technical details method is
illustrated automatic construction 
recursive iterative programs operating natural
numbers lists trees order construct 
a program satisfying specifications theorem
induced specifications proved 
the desired program extracted proof the
same technique applied transform recursively 
defined functions iterative programs frequently
with major gain inefficiency emphasized 
that order construct program loops with
recursion principle mathematical induction 
must applied relation version of
the induction rule form program 
constructed explored detail
