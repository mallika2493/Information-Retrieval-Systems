this paper addresses problem of
analyzing data generated computer simulations 
of economic systems turn hypothetical firm 
whose operation represented single-channel 
multistation queueing model firm seeks maximize
total expected profit coming period 
by selecting operating plans each
plan incorporates marketing strategy 
an allocation productive inputs total cost 
 results simulated activity 
plan subjected f-test multiple comparison
methods multiple ranking method 
illustrate compare evaluate techniques 
 paper adopts position 
technique analysis possibly 
chosen experimenter expression 
of experimental objective f-test tests homogeneity
of plans multiple comparison methods 
quantify differences multiple ranking methods
directly identify plan
