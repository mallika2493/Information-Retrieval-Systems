a man-machine approach solving traveling salesman problem

the traveling salesman problem belongs an
important class scheduling routing problems 
 subproblem solving as
the warehouse distribution problem 
attacked mathematical methods meager
success special forms problem 
or problems moderate number points can
it solved exactly large amounts 
of computer time heuristic procedures have
been proposed tested slightly 
results paper describes computer aided heuristic
technique modest amount 
computer time real-time solve large 100-200 
point problems technique takes advantage 
both computer human problem-solving
abilities computer asked solve 
problem brute force today heuristics 
but asked organize data 
the human human solve problem easily 
 technique paper 
point directions field man-machine interaction
and field artificial intelligence
