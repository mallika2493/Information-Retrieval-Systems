numerical integration function pole

it common need integrate numerically
functions diverge 
range integration divergence occurs quite
far integration formulas simpson 
that depend fitting polynomial be
inaccurate pole bad 
a method formulas integrate
functions kind accurately 
orders positions poles known explicit
formulas easy 
automatic computer shown used
for singularities poles 
 integral converges integration carried
to singularity accuracy integration 
with pole order discussed 
the formula compared simpson 
 formulas pole 
while pole advantage overwhelming
