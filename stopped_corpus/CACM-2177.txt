an efficient method presented finding
blocks cutnodes arbitrary undirected 
graph graph represented an
ordered list edges ii packed adjacency 
matrix denotes word length machine
employed storage machine words required 
for graph nodes edges increases essentially
as 2 case 2 win case 
 ii spanning tree labeled edges grown 
two edges finally bearing labels 
only belong blocks representations
the time required analyze graph 
on nodes increases depends type
of graph 1 2 bounds attained 
 values derived suitable
families test graphs generated extension
