hierarchical storage information retrieval

a probabilistic analysis employed determine
the effect hierarchical storage organizations 
on information retrieval operations data storage
hardware assumed consist n-levels 
linearly connected memory hardware increasing data
access times increasing data storage capabilities 
 system consist fast semiconductor
memory computer core memory extended core 
storage disk memory data cells equations derived
to predict effect system 
data access times sequential random access 
and structured employing multiple-hierarchical 
linked lists
