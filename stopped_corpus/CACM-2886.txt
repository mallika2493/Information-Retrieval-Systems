this paper describes attribute grammars their
use definition programming languages 
and compilers formal definition attribute grammars
and discussion important aspects 
are included paper concentrates evaluation
of semantic attributes passes left 
to derivation tree program a
condition attribute grammar 
assures semantics program evaluated
in single pass derivation tree 
and algorithm discussed decides many
passes left general 
given attribute grammar notions explained
in terms grammar describes 
the scope rules algol 60 practical questions such
as relative efficiency evaluation 
schemes ease adapting attribute grammar
of programming language left-to-right
