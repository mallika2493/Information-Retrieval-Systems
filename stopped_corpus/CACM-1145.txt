of directed line graphs isomorphism 

given pair directed line graphs problem
of ascertaining isomorphic 
is efficient algorithmic solution known 
 straightforward enumerative algorithm 
might require 40 years running time high
speed computer order compare 15-node 
graphs sophisticated approach called
for situation similar prevailing 
in areas game-playing theorem-proving where
practical algorithms unknown interesting 
cases practical partially
successful techniques git-graph 
isomorphism tester-incorporates variety processes
that attempt narrow search 
isomorphism demonstrate exists one
scheme relied exclusively solution 
and program designed avoid excessive computation
along fruitless lines git written 
in comit language successfully tested ibm 7090
