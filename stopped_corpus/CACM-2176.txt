a fixed buffer allocation merge-sorting
is presented minimizes number 
input-output operations order merge 
 sorting movable arm disks number 
seeks equal number input-output operations 
and seek time controls sort 
time standard terminology introduced 
then input buffer allocation method 
followed analysis improvement expected
over conventional allocation analysis 
makes distribution function an
analysis completely distribution 
is yields similar results suggests
that results depend 
distribution function optimum output buffer size
is determined concluded 
buffering allocation significantly reduce time
of merge sorting movable arm disks 
input data random output buffer
allocation data
