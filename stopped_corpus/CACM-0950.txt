this paper dedicated proposition 
in order take full advantage real-time 
computations highly parallel computers be
expected future 
of numerical analysis recast more
 parallel form meant serial 
algorithms replaced algorithm which
consist subtasks computed 
without knowledge results subtasks 
as method proposed parallelizing 
the numerical integration ordinary differential
equation process standard methods 
is entirely serial
