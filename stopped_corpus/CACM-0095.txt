a set ordinary differential equations which
contains mathematical functions requiring 
use subroutines numerical solution electronic
computer tabular data numerical solution 
by hand calculation function generators analog
methods applied expanded 
to equivalent set equations contain
the functions practical functions 
satisfy sufficiently simple differential equations 
thus functions eliminated 
by procedure trigonometric inverse trigonometric 
exponential transcendental
