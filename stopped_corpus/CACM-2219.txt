a policy-driven scheduler time-sharing system

the service received process time-sharing
operating system characterized 
by resource count sum wr the
number units service received process 
i resource cost unit the
service class users characterized 
by policy function specifies amount service
a user belongs class receive 
as function time priority dynamically
as function difference service 
promised user policy function service
he actually receives scheduling swapping 
algorithm keeps resource count process
above policy function provide 
level service overhead reduced avoiding
swaps process received 
his level service algorithm implemented
in general purpose operating system 
it provided significantly service interactive
and batch jobs previous scheduler
