dynamic response time prediction computer networks

if ultimate aim computing network
is resource sharing human component 
well technical component networking must
be fully investigated achieve goal 
research step assisting user participating
in vast store resources 
on network analytical simulation statistical performance
evaluation tools employed investigate 
the feasibility dynamic response time monitor
that capable providing comparative response 
time information users wishing process various
computing applications network computing 
node research clearly reveals sufficient
system data obtainable 
the diverse arpa network systems studied detail 
to describe predict response time 
network time-sharing systems depends some
