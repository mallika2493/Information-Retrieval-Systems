dynamic programming recently used
by stone bellman gluss determine 
closet fit broken line segments curve an
interval constraint number 
segments fixed present paper successive
models developed extend method 
fitting broken plane segments surfaces defined
over types subareas -space 
 model considers rectangular area with
the constraint plane segments defined 
over grid -space shown how
this model incorporated algorithm 
that successive approximations optimal fits
for type closed area finally applications 
are briefly
