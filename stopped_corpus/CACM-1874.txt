complement machine ibm 360

the familiar multiplicative congruential generator
is examined context type 
two complement arithmetic ibm 360 series 
 sequences residues considered 
and relationships established shown
that sequence positive negative residues 
may produced simply economically with
the conventional approach 
period loss desirable statistical
properties easily generated sequence 
involving absolute values shown twice
the period attractive statistical 
properties statistical properties sequences
are related previously established
