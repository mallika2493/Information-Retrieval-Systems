peaks digitized waveform detected an
algorithm incorporating piecewise linear approximation 
and tabular parsing techniques parameters serve
to identify waveform context enabling accurate 
measurement peak amplitude duration shape the
algorithm sufficient speed allow on-line 
real-time processing application
