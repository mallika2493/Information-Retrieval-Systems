a fast fourier transform algorithm real-valued series

a procedure presented calculating the
complex discrete fourier transform real-valued 
time series procedure example
where number points series 
an integral power algorithm preserves
the order symmetry cooley-turkey fast 
fourier transform algorithm effecting two-to-one
reduction computation storage 
can achieved series real discussed
are hardware software implementations 
the algorithm perform 4 log2 2 complex
multiply add operations require 
only real storage locations analyzing n-point record
