a process determination of
addresses variable length addressing

an algorithm presented assignment
of instruction addresses formats 
following conditions 1 length instruction varies
as function distance instruction 
from target 2 exists optimality criterion
which implies preferential choices subject 
to addressing constraints 
achieving smallest number long instructions 
in case total code length minimized or
minimizing assigned address point 
in program algorithm suitable arbitrary
program structure choice optimization
