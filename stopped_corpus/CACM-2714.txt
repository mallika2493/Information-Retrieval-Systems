consider linearly ordered sets 
 parallel processors 
working synchronously paper presents algorithm
for merging parallel processors 
which requires 2 log2
 steps 2 integer 
the algorithm requires 2 2 
steps case 
same order magnitude km constant 
the algorithm requires 2 3 
steps performances compare favorably with
the previous parallel merging algorithm 
batcher algorithm requires 2p log2 m
steps general case km 1 2 log2 
m special case km
