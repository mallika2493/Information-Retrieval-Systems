simulation presented practical technique
for performance evaluation alternative 
configurations highly concurrent computers technique
is constructing detailed 
deterministic simulation model system model
a control stream replaces instruction 
data streams real system simulation the
system model yields timing resource usage 
statistics needed performance evaluation without
the necessity emulating system case 
study implementation simulator model
of cpu-memory subsystem ibm 360 91 
described results evaluating alternative
system designs discussed experiments 
reveal case study major bottlenecks
in system memory unit fixed 
point unit appears sophisticated
pipelining buffering technique simplemented 
in architecture ibm 360 91 little
value high-speed cache memory
