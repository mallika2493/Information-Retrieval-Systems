simulation traffic flows network

a computer simulation program deals
with traffic flows network large area 
is road segmented blocks of
several ten-meter lengths represented 
a bidirectional list computer memory movement
of cars transfer cars block 
to expressed proper formula this
formula based supposition speed 
of cars block determined density of
cars block speed-versus-density 
curve empirically numerical values this
simulation scheme excellent point 
it makes trace dynamic behavior
of traffic flows variety situations 
examples actual area city kyoto japan
