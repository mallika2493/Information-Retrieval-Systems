algorithms linear programming

a statistical comparison primal-dual
and commonly primal-simplex algorithm 
for solving linear programming problems made under
the assumption starting full artificial 
basis conditions primal-dual method
shows statistically significant superiority 
randomly generated problems found via
a regression analysis relevant parameters 
in determining difference number iterations
between algorithms number 
of constraints number variables but
also ratio
