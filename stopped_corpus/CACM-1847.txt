an algorithm finding fundamental set cycles graph

a fast method presented finding fundamental
set cycles undirected finite 
graph spanning tree grown vertices examined
in turn unexamined vertices stored 
in pushdown list await examination stage
in process take top element 
pushdown list examine inspect those
edges graph 
been examined tree fundamental
cycle added edge 
placed tree exactly stage
for vertices graph large 
n store required creases 2 time as
n depends type graph involved 
 bounded 2 3 shown
that bounds attained terms 
storage algorithm similar gotlieb and
corneil superior welch terms 
of speed similar welch superior
to gotlieb corneil testsshow 
algorithm remarkably efficient 2 random graphs
