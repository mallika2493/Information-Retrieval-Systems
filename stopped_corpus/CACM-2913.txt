certain defects jagged edges and
disappearing detail long annoyance 
in digitally generated shaded images increasing
the resolution defocusing display 
attenuate understanding defects leads
to effective methods paper explains 
the observed defects terms aliasing phenomenon
inherent sampled signals discusses prefiltering 
as recognized cure method evaluating filters
is presented application prefiltering 
to hidden-surface algorithms discussed implementation
of filtering tiler shown accompanied
