matrix reduction-an efficient method

the paper describes efficient method for
reduction binary matrices arise 
some school time-tabling problems development
of john lions 
generalized adapted fit complete timetabling
process compact data representation 
and efficient processing techniques take fuller
advantage previous knowledge 
about matrix designed structured
program readily coded reader 
in high level low level programming language
of choice practical tests method 
shown good basis realistic timetabling algorithm
