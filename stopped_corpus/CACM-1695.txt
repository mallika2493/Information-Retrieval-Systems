plexus-an on-line system modeling neural networks

a description presented plexus system
which enables user construct 
a neural network analyze output data produced
by network store retrieve networks 
and data library system operated entirely
from digital display unit interacts directly 
with user permits easy rapid transitions
between phases modeling process 
 plexus designed complement neurophysiological research
so systematic development neural 
models coordinated experimental work plexus
networks built components representing 
individual neurons external stimuli interconnecting
fibers component 
detailed nature provision made of
experimental data input network convenient 
means specification modification network and
extensive error-checking capabilities provided 
data resulting simulation network be
analyzed variety techniques ranging 
examinations gross characteristics data to
the determination detailed statistical properties
