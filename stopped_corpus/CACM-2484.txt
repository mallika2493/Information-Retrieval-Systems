a note information organization storage

since logical structure data base
can represented tree graph 
natural view process designing data
base constructing tree graph 
 general method constructing tree graph
is provided important elements 
in general construction method set of
binary relations algorithm constructing 
subsets set algorithm selecting an
element set objects 
different relations algorithms results different
information structures list tree ring 
etc problem information organization and
storage reduced defining relations 
and formulating algorithms set constraints 
 results presented valuable 
designers design concepts serve as
a basis developing formal theory subject
