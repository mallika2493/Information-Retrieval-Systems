an iterative factorization technique polynomials

an iterative technique displayed factors
of arbitrary degree found polynomials 
in variable convergence shown occur always
if jacobian vanish 
initial approximation factor an
actual factor process simply programmed 
and preliminary results adapted
to digital computers factors 
degree technique similar bairstow 
the present method simpler
