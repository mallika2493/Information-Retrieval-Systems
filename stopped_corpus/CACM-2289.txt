a cellular array two-dimensional checkerboard
type interconnection identical modules 
 cells cell bits of
memory small amount combinational logic 
and communicates mainly neighbors
in array chief computational advantage 
offered cellular arrays improvement speed
achieved virtue possibilities parallel 
processing paper shown cellular
arrays inherently suited solution 
of graph problems adjacency
matrix graph easily mapped array 
each matrix element stored cell array 
and typical row column operations readily 
implemented simple cell logic major challenge
in effective cellular arrays 
solution graph problems determination algorithms
that exploit possibilities parallelism 
especially problems solutions inherently
serial parallelized 
algorithms presented solution certain
spanning tree distance path problems 
direct applications wire routing pert chart analysis 
and analysis types networks 
 algorithms exhibit computation time in
many cases grows rate exceeding log2 
where number nodes graph straightforward
cellular implementations well-known 
serial algorithms problems require n
steps noncellular implementations require 
n 2 3 steps
