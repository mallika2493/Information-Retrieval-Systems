two-level control structure nondeterministic programming

the basic ideas nondeterministic programming
are critically reconsidered single 
proper attitude programming style language allowing
direct control nondeterministic features 
 proposed attitude aims retaining purity of
the nondeterministic formulation search processes 
on level attempt level deferring coordination
of problem solving efforts 
choice level feasibility recognizing two
levels discussed stressing structure 
to managed choice level free contexts 
 leaves computational environments 
each holding alternative inspection while
the nodes choice poin ts 
 according proposed programming style generative
function choice poin 
which expresses desired choice strategy main
advantage approach localization 
of search strategies nonterminal node the
tree keeps track state computation 
as choice poin interrogated 
holding time strategy coordinate 
the alternatives examples in
term nd-lisp extension lisp designed 
implemented according guidelines
