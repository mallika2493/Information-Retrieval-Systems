a fast algorithm computing longest common subsequences

previously published algorithms finding
the longest common subsequence sequences 
of length best-case running time 2 
 algorithm problem presented 
which running time log r
is total number ordered pairs positions 
at sequences match worst
case algorithm running time 2 log 
n applications positions
of sequence match positions
