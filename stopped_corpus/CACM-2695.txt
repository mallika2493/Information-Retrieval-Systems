tridiagonalization permutations

tridiagonalizing matrix similarity transformations
is important computational tool 
in numerical linear algebra consider class sparse
matrices tridiagonalized 
only row column permutations the
advantages transformation include 
the absence round-off errors improved computation time
when compared standard transformations 
 graph theoretic algorithm examines arbitrary
n matrix determines 
can permuted tridiagonal form the
algorithm requires arithmetic number 
of comparisons number assignments number
of increments linear compares 
very favorably standard transformation methods 
 matrix permutable tridiagonal form 
the algorithm explicit tridiagonal form 
 early rejection occur
