an approach implementing smart interface
to support relational view data proposed 
 basic idea employ automatic programming techniques
so interface analyzes efficiently 
refines high level query specification supplied by
the user relational algebra interface called 
squiral designed approach described
in detail squiral seeks minimize query 
response time space utilization 1 performing
global query optimization 2 exploiting disjoint 
and pipelined concurrency 3 coordinating sort orders
in temporary relations 4 employing directory 
analysis 5 maintaining locality page references 
 algorithms implementing operators 
of codd relational algebra presented and
a methodology composing optimize 
performance user query
