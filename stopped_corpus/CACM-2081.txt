some complete calculi matrices

a matrix calculus introduced intention developing data structures
suitable high level algorithmic language mathematical programming 
the paper investigates special structure matrices described
and utilized efficient computing saving memory space and
superfluous operations sequences matrices sequences sequences
of matrices considered matrix operators areext
ended sequence operators cumulative operators algorithms
are symbol manipulation matrix expressions so
as find forms suited computation forms are
called normal forms completeness results obtained
in sense expression equivalent expression
in normal form found calculus
