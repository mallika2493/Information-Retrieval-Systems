the selection optimal tab settings

a generation computer terminals allows
tab settings selected set computer 
 feature reduce number characters
that needed represent document 
for transmission printing note algorithm
is selecting optimal set 
tab stops minimizing number characters transmitted 
 implementation algorithm 
reduced number characters transmitted from
7 30 percent requires prepass 
the document compute matrix determining
the optimal set tab stops fixed tab 
stops heuristic alternative achieve
about 80 percent optimal prepass
