a model interleaved memory systems presented 
and analysis model monte 
carlo simulation discussed simulations investigate
the performance system structures 
i schemes sending instruction data requests
to memory system performance measured 
by determining distribution number memory
modules operation memory cycle 
an important observation investigations that
separately grouping instruction data requests 
for memory substantially increase average number
of memory modules operation memory
