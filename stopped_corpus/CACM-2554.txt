an algorithm reducing the
generalized eigenvalue problem ax lambda bx 
an ordinary problem case symmetric band
matrices positive definite 
order matrix bandwidth matrices
a partitioned m-by-m blocks 
the algorithm terms blocks 
 algorithm reduces generalized problem 
an ordinary eigenvalue problem symmetric band
matrix bandwidth 
 algorithm similar rutishauser and
schwartz reduction symmetric matrices 
to band form calculation requires order mn 2
operation round-off error calculation 
of order sum errors at
each steps algorithm 
errors largely determined condition respect inversion
