new lisp techniques paging environment

the system employs block
concept global local variables 
in addition methods applied lisp systems 
 means list representation 
used local sequential lists created compilation 
and block level sequential 
created dynamically garbage collection algorithm
has introduced make lists compact 
as partial garbage collection performed after
each block exit total garbage collection 
when storage exhausted algorithm use
the customary flagging procedure combination 
of features eliminated need free list 
and effectively minimizes number pages 
at moment
